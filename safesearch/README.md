# Safe Search

Safe search is a list of set IP addresses that is meant to pre-enable the
safe search of search portals.

This zone file contains all known IP to spoof safe search enabled search sites

## Spoofing

There are different approaches of spoof domains depending on the resolver used
for this.

### Dnsdist

For example in PowerDns Dnsdist you will do it like this:

```lua
addAction('duckduckgo.com.', SpoofCNAMEAction('safe.duckduckgo.com.'))
```

### RPZ

In standard RPZ you will do it like this:

```python
duckduckgo.com IN CNAME safe.duckduckgo.com
```

### Unbound

In unbound you need to assign IP spoofing like this

```python
local-zone: "duckduckgo.com." redirect
local-data: "duckduckgo.com. IN CNAME safe.duckduckgo.com."
```

### Hosts

In hosts file you forced to have a tremendous big list of IP host like this

```shell
54.229.105.151  duckduckgo.com
79.125.105.136  duckduckgo.com
79.125.106.1    duckduckgo.com
```
